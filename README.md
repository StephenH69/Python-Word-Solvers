# Python Word Solvers

A set of basic scripts to help solve word puzzles, including anagram solving, finding a word with characters missing (good for crosswords) and finding all the words within a given string.

The missing letter word finder uses a classic regex algorithm which then searches a file based on the number of characters in the word.


### Full Word File
There are a mixture of a full text file of almost 200,000 GB English words and a set of files where these words have been split into separate files.

This split has been derived from the larger file using the file **splitwordlist.py**.


### Anagram Solver 
##### anagramsolver.py

This file contains the word solvers. There are 3 choices:

 1. Complete the word
 2. Solve the anagram
 3. Find all words within a character set

The first option is currently open with the others commented out.

### Contributions
Willing for others to give advice on how to make these run quicker as would like to use them as the basis for a web app.
